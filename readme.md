#What This?#
It's a little F# console app for ~~stalking the shit out of people~~ tracking users of mindme.care devices and sending pushbullet alerts based on simple conditions.

# Why This? #
I have a relative with dementia, sometimes they get lost. With handy GPS tracking we can now always find them, but that relies on someone checking the tracker and could lead to situations where they are away from home in need of help and it takes a long time before anyone notices. With this app, alerts are generated based on certain conditions (currently, leaves/returns home and stops/starts moving while away from home) that will hopefully prevent slow response to situations

#How I Use This?#
Set home coordinates, and recipients up in the code, run the app, provide login details for the mindme website, and that's pretty much it.

If you have ideas for betterer code or features or whatever, make a pull request and I'll be filled with happiness that someone else benefited from this stuff :D
